# DSA Problem 1 – Check Sum Zero (JavaScript)

## 🚀 Problem Statement

Given an array of integers, determine if any two numbers sum up to zero.

## 🧠 Objective

This problem helps build understanding of:
- Array traversal
- Brute-force approach with nested loops
- Logical thinking with condition checking
- Optimization (if attempted with Set/hashmap)

---

## 🛠️ Solution

I solved this using the brute-force approach by comparing each element with the rest of the array.
